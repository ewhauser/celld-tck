// Every case drives a documented v0.5.0 operational control — weighted
// ownership placement, balancing pause and resume, a graceful drain, a
// same-node preserve, a rolling binary upgrade — across a three-node fleet
// that holds several cells, and keeps ownership, readiness and
// acknowledged-write evidence across the operation. The controls, where they
// live on the binary, and the limits of this coverage are recorded in
// docs/FLEET-OPERATIONS.md. Orchestration lives here; every classification is
// a pure oracle in OperationsOracles.ts.
